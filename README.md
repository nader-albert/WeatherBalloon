#TODO
* Sample Feed File, is generated by the ProducerApp under the project folder. While the ConsumerApp, tries to load it from the resource directory. This has to be sorted out 
* The mean temperature, and the number of observations from each observatory, and the total distance travelled, are not calculated.
* The State of the Min and Max Temperature should be moved to the ResultPublisher. Capturing them as part of the different 
workers state, produce misleading results in the output file.
* Unit Test Cases should be written. Scala Test to test the Logic and Akak Test Probe to test the correctness of the mesaging flow.
* Congigurations should be made available from Command Line

#Assumptions / Simplifications:
* Calculating the Min, Max temperatures ignored the different units corresponding to different observatories.
* Dates / Locations were left static 

#To run the code
* The system works with two different Apps (ProducerApp and ConsumerApp)
* The ProducerApp starts first to generate the sample test data. It generates 500 Million record in around 8 minutes and writes them to a file 
whose size reaches 19 GB.
* The build is done sbt, and the sbt-plugin is added to the list of plugins.
